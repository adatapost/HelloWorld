 Exe (Self executables) - Dll (executable)
 ==================================================================================
 
 Both; assemblies contains the "compiled" code but the "exe" assembly code will never be shared to other assemblies whereas the "dll" assemblies are created for this purpose; to share the (or reuse) compiled code without copying+pasting into any other assemblies.
 
 The "exe" assembly must have an entry point - main() method which will be bootstraped by the OS or sub framework.
	For instanace, ASP.NET web app, mobile apps & service app framework (sub sub frameworks) automatically
	bootstrap the main() function so we don't have to create an "exe" assembly but they (ASP.NEt, mobile) always 	produce .dll 	assemblies.

 [NOTE: DLL assembly must be referenced to other DLL or EXE whereas "EXE" can't]
